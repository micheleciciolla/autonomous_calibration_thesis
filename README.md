This Master Thesis project is developed with the support of the Star s.r.l company in Latina (RM) which is giving me the opportunity to deal with real machine vision problems in industrial robotics scenario. The machine vision software which i'm developing my project with is LMI HexSight, a powerful VB.NET library.

The goal of this thesis is to let the calibration process of the cameras be autonomous and human-interaction free as opposed to what is being done now, given that both the pixel coordinates and real world coordinates grabbing process needs the work of a human operator.
